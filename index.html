    My favorite game is raft becuase you are stuck on a raft and you have to build and paint to make it look better and there is a shark will come after what you have built and go chomp chomp chomp until that piece of the raft his eating is gone also his name is bruce and you can make bows and arows metal kind of stone kind to get those segulls always above your raft and make sure you have food and water to stay alive or else you will die there are rats that attack you chickens drop eggs you get milk from goats and a lama does nothing there are big islands small islands floating rafts that when you steep on it it will start to sink bit it has chest with goodies and at the end you will find a HUGE dome/island and at the start you will find a radio tower and will have to do parkour to finish it and there is some underwater you use a hook to get the trash in the water.
